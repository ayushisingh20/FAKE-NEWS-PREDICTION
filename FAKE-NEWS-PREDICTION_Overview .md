# Steps for Fake News Prediction System using Logistic Regression in Python:

# Importing Dependencies:
Import necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.

# Data Collection and Processing:
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, containing information about news articles, authors, and labels (fake or not).
Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Combine author names and news titles for prediction.
Implement stemming to reduce words to their root forms.

# Text to Numerical Conversion:
Use the TfidfVectorizer to convert textual data into numerical data.
Apply TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to assign numerical values to words based on their importance.
Train-Test Split:

# Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
Utilize stratify=Y to maintain a balanced class distribution in the split.

# Logistic Regression Model:
Create a Logistic Regression model.
Train the model on the prepared training data.

# Evaluation:
Calculate accuracy scores on the training data using the accuracy_score metric.
Emphasize the need for model evaluation on the test data, considering metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for a comprehensive assessment.

# Additional Pre-processing (Stemming):
Implement stemming using a defined function to reduce words to their root forms, improving the efficiency of text data processing.

# Summary:
Develop a Fake News Prediction System using Logistic Regression.
Utilize comprehensive pre-processing, text-to-numerical conversion, and evaluation techniques to ensure model effectiveness.
Incorporate stemming for enhanced feature extraction and generalization.
Emphasize the importance of evaluating the model on test data for robust performance analysis.
